flowBeads
=========

This is the public repository for the Bioconductor package for working with calibration beads in flow cytometry.
Based on flowCore package.

This package has received quite a lot of recent attention, in particular I have received a lot of questions about relative normalisation when no MEF is specified.
I think this is possible provided that the number of peaks is consistent.

Here is some R code of how to go about it:

```R
library(flowCore)

```
